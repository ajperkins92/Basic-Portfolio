            <p id="initial-intro">Hi, my name is Alex Perkins and I'm so glad you're dropping by my portfolio!</p>
            <p id="second-paragraph">A little about me; I grew up in a small college town in Minnesota called
                Northfield. If you've ever heard of Saint Olaf or Carleton colleges, or Malt-o-Meal cereal, then you
                know something about Northfield!</p>
            <p id="third-paragraph">I began dabbling in software development/coding about a year ago after trying to
                create a website to write about my various endeavors. That's when I realized I enjoy writing code,
                particularly the combination of the scientific and artistic!</p>
            <p class="clearfix">When I'm not at work as a Technical Account Manager at SkyKick, I can be found haning
                out with my wife, Waverly, playing with our two bunnies Sage and Juniper, playing a board game (Scythe
                is a current favorite), going on a hike, playing guitar, or drinking a beer in one of Seattle's many
                excellent drinking establishments!</p>
